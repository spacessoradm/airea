Step 1 — Build or Import an MRT/LRT Station Database
You can’t guess station locations — you need a full dataset.
Tell Replit:
“Get me a list of all MRT, LRT, Monorail, and KTM stations in Malaysia with their names, line names, and GPS coordinates (lat/lng). Store this in a database table called stations with columns: id, station_name, line, latitude, longitude.”
💡 Sources:
You can scrape official MRT/LRT line data from RapidKL’s website or Wikipedia.
Alternatively, you can manually compile in CSV → import into PostgreSQL/MySQL.
Step 2 — Add latitude/longitude to Every Property Listing
This is crucial so you can calculate distance from MRT.
Tell Replit:
“Ensure every property in the database has latitude and longitude coordinates. If not provided, geocode the address using Nominatim or Google Maps API.”
Step 3 — Search Logic for “Near MRT”
Now you need geospatial querying.
Example in SQL (PostGIS-enabled):
SELECT p.*, s.station_name, 
       ST_DistanceSphere(
           ST_MakePoint(p.longitude, p.latitude),
           ST_MakePoint(s.longitude, s.latitude)
       ) AS distance_m
FROM properties p
JOIN stations s ON ST_DistanceSphere(
                     ST_MakePoint(p.longitude, p.latitude),
                     ST_MakePoint(s.longitude, s.latitude)
                 ) <= 1000
WHERE p.bedrooms = 3
ORDER BY distance_m ASC;
Explanation:
<= 1000 → within 1 km of an MRT station.
You can change to 500m or 2km based on “near” definition.
If you don’t use PostGIS, you can still use Haversine formula in code to filter properties within radius.
Step 4 — Natural Language Parsing
So the user can type “3-bedroom condo near MRT” instead of clicking filters.
Tell Replit:
“Implement a simple NLP parser that detects:
Number of bedrooms (e.g., ‘3-bedroom’ → bedrooms = 3)
Proximity requirement (‘near MRT’, ‘near LRT’ → radius search from stations table)
Property type (‘condo’, ‘apartment’ → property_type = condo)
Then build an SQL query dynamically using these extracted filters.”
You can do this with:
OpenAI API for natural language → structured query.
Or simple regex + keyword mapping for MVP.
Search Bar Flow
User types: "3 bedroom condo near MRT"
System extracts:
bedrooms = 3
property_type = condo
near_station = true
DB query runs with radius filter from MRT stations list.
Results are sorted by closest station distance.
