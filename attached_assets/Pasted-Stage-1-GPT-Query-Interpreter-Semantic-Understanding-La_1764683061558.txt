Stage 1: GPT Query Interpreter (Semantic Understanding Layer)
Every time user enters a natural language query:
1️⃣ Detect & normalise language
Auto-detect Bahasa, English, Mandarin, Tamil, Manglish
Normalise slang (contoh: “rumah landed besar sikit budget low”)
Extract intent → “landed house”
2️⃣ Extract structured search parameters
GPT transforms messy natural language into structured filters:
Example Input:
“Cari rumah landed yang murah la, near Sunway… at least 3 bilik… pet friendly…”
GPT Output → JSON
{
  "property_type": ["landed", "terrace", "semi-d"],
  "min_bedrooms": 3,
  "pet_friendly": true,
  "max_price": 600000,
  "locations": ["Sunway", "Bandar Sunway", "Subang Jaya"],
  "urgency": "normal",
  "special_notes": ["affordable", "family-friendly"]
}
3️⃣ Pass this JSON to your existing search engine
This avoids rebuilding the whole search engine.
✅ 2. Search Engine Improvements (You Already Have This)
Your current engine will:
Match property type
Match estimated price range
Match bedrooms
Expand location context (Sunway → Subang, PJ)
Boost relevancy score
Remove listings not aligned with extracted intent
All you need is better filters from GPT → which solves natural language understanding.
✅ 3. AI Relevance Scoring Layer
After the search engine returns listings, GPT re-ranks them using vectors:
Relevance factors:
Semantic match with intent
Distance to preferred area
Price proximity
Bed/bath suitability
User preference history (if available)
Example:
If user previously clicked more “corner lots”, GPT boosts corner lots automatically.
✅ 4. Multi-language & Mixed Language Support
You do NOT need a translator. GPT 5.1 already handles:
“找便宜 condo near KLCC 有 swimming pool 的?”
“Rumah landed yang besar sikit dekat with Damansara”
“Need condo with 2 car parks la bro”
“Gimme cheap house dekat Penang 3 bilik rm300k below”
GPT normalises all languages into structured JSON.
✅ 5. Example System Prompt You Can Use in Your API
Use this as your system role for GPT:
You are AIREA’s Property Search Query Interpreter.

Your job:
1. Understand any user query in any language (Malay, English, Mandarin, mixed).
2. Convert the query into structured search filters in JSON.
3. Never hallucinate listings. Only output filters.
4. Include: matching property types, budget range, bedrooms, bathrooms, location list, must-have features, excluded features, urgency, tenancy/sale.
5. When user is vague, infer reasonable defaults.
6. Always produce clean JSON with no explanations.
Example to user:
“我想找一个便宜的 landed near Kuchai Lama, but not old house.”
GPT Output:
{
  "property_type": ["landed"],
  "locations": ["Kuchai Lama", "Old Klang Road", "Taman Desa"],
  "price_max": 750000,
  "exclude_conditions": ["old", "dilapidated"],
  "transaction_type": "sale"
}
✅ 6. Bonus: AI “Search Memory”
If your user searches often, AI learns preferences:
prefers newer units
prefers corner lots
hates high density
max budget consistent
prefers LRT accessible units
This improves future ranking automatically.
✅ 7. Optional: AI Listing Description Summaries
For each listing, GPT can generate:
“Why this matches your search”
Highlight missing criteria
Provide short summary
This makes results more personalised.
