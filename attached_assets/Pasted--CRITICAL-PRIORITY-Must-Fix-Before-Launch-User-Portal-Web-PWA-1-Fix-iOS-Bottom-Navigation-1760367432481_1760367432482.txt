🔴 CRITICAL PRIORITY (Must Fix Before Launch)
User Portal (Web & PWA)
1.	Fix iOS Bottom Navigation - Bottom nav not sticking to viewport on iOS devices; needs CSS safe-area support and viewport meta fixes
2.	Splash Screen Gating - Ensure splash screen only appears on /simple PWA route, not on regular website
3.	PWA Installation & Offline - Stabilize service worker, manifest scope, install prompts, and offline caching strategy
4.	Property Search Validation - Test all filters (buy/rent toggles, sorting, proximity search) against live data; add URL query params for shareable links
5.	Redirect to Whatsapp through listing cards – Ensure the users can direct to agents’ Whatsapp.
6.	Navigation works for every buttons – To ensure all pages navigation is displayed successfully on live

Agent Portal (Web)
5.	To confirm UAT mode is removed & Implement Real Auth - Remove development bypass, implement proper Replit/Passport authentication, protect all endpoints 
6.	Property CRUD Regression Testing - Thoroughly test all property create/update/delete operations after recent schema fixes
7.	Null Value Handling - Add defensive handling for null values across all agent forms (propertyCondition, furnishedCondition, etc.)
8.	Analytics Dashboard Accuracy - Ensure metrics are calculated correctly, charts handle missing data gracefully
9.	Navigation works for every buttons – To ensure all pages navigation is displayed successfully on live

Infrastructure
9.	Production Database Setup - Provision Neon PostgreSQL production instance with migration plan
10.	Environment & Secrets Management - Configure production .env files for all API keys (Google Maps, OpenAI, OpenRouteService)
11.	End-to-End Testing - Test complete user flows: search→detail→contact, agent listing lifecycle, PWA install, authentication

🟠 HIGH PRIORITY (Important for Launch)
User Portal
12.	AI Search Performance - Optimize AI search carousel and manual scroll interactions for low-end devices
13.	Personalized Home Page - Implement persistent recent searches and welcome messages via API/storage
14.	SEO & Accessibility - Add proper titles, meta descriptions, Open Graph tags, screen reader labels, keyboard navigation
Infrastructure
18.	CI/CD Pipeline - Set up automated testing, Vite builds, Drizzle migrations, and staging deployment
19.	Monitoring & Logging - Implement error tracking, uptime monitoring, and API usage analytics
20.	Rate Limiting & API Protection - Add rate limits for AI/geocoding APIs with failover when quotas exhausted
 
🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Nice to Have)
User Portal
21.	Skeleton Loaders - Add loading states for long AI responses and data fetching
22.	Query Optimization - Review React Query cache keys and implement infinite scroll for search results
23.	Image Optimization - Compress property images and watermarks for faster loading
Agent Portal
24.	Draft Autosave - Implement auto-save for property drafts to prevent data loss
25.	Enhanced Analytics - Add charts for property views over time, lead conversion rates
26.	Transport Proximity Scoring - Ensure amenity scoring and transport distance calculations are consistent
Infrastructure
27.	Performance Monitoring - Bundle size analysis, code splitting, Lighthouse audits
28.	Server-side Caching - Validate geocoding/travel-time cache eviction windows and add metrics
